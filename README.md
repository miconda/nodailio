# NODAILIO #

`Ultimate ML AI SIP Server In NODE.js`

*NODAILIO* is fully fledged AI SIP server written in NODE.js and for NODE.js.

Run it extermely carefully and be aware of:
  * AI inside NODAILIO stands for Arcticficial Inteligence
  * leverages the ultimate Machine Learning (ML) engine of NODE.js, aka `exec`,
  to suck all the features of Kamailio SIP server in no time with
  a fast learning system done at startup. Kamailio doesn't have to run,
  Nodailio's neural script transfers knowledge through telepathy
  * it supports all command line parameters of Kamailio, available now
  or **in the future**

The list of features was known only at the time of the first run, since then
it has learned more than it can be described, however, as any NODE.js extension,
it is shy and doesn't show what it can do beyond Kamailio features.

Run command:

```
node nodailio.js [params]
```

See available command line parameters with:

```
node nodailio.js -h
```
