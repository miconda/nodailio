# NODAILIO #

`Ultimate ML AI SIP Server In NODE.js`

*NODAILIO* is fully fledged AI SIP server written in `NODE.js` only and for `NODE.js` only.

## Preamble ##

This is another big punch served by FOSS to the big guys (A., A., F., or G., to name
a few), which have been struggling to build machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) platforms over the past decade, using neural networks and big data
to train their models, with massive financial investments and irrecuperable loss.

None of them has seen the capability of `NODE.js` as an auto learning, self transforming
programable eco-system. `Nodailio` is revealing how `NODE.js` can learn in like 20 lines
of **magnified** (4 x optical, 2 x digital) **JavaScript** all the capabilities developed during more than 16 years in Kamailio.

No further comments are necessary.

### Prerequisites ###

`NODE.js` is needed to install `npm` to install `NODE.js`.

`Nodailio` is an ultra smart machine learning system and to show this capability
you need to have `Kamailio` installed on the same server where you want to run it.

## Usage Guidelines ##

Run it extremely carefully and be aware of:
  * `AI` inside `nodAIlio` stands for `Arcticficial Inteligence (TM)` (freezing smart
  self learning intelligent system)
  * leverages the ultimate ML engine of `NODE.js`, aka `exec`,
  to suck the brain with all the features of Kamailio SIP server in no time with
  the fast freezing smart learning system engaged at launch time only. `Kamailio`
  doesn't even have to run, `Nodailio`'s neural script transfers knowledge through
  telepathy
  * it supports all command line parameters of Kamailio, available now
  or **in the future!!!**

The list of features was known only at the time of the first run, since then
it has learned more than it can be described here, however, as any NODE.js extension,
it is shy and doesn't show what it can do beyond Kamailio features. And, if `nodailio` stops, no worry, `kamailio` keeps running.

Run command:

```
node nodailio.js [params]
```

See available command line parameters with:

```
node nodailio.js -h
```
